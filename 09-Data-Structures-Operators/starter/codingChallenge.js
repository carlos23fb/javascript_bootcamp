// TODO  We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ï¿½)!
// TODO  Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
// TODO  next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
// TODO  Your tasks:
// TODO  1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
// TODO  'players2')
// TODO  2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
// TODO  players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
// TODO  goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
// TODO  field players
// TODO  3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
// TODO  players)
// TODO  4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
// TODO  new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
// TODO  'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
// TODO  5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
// TODO  'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
// TODO  6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
// TODO  names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
// TODO  number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
// TODO  7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which
// TODO  team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
// TODO  operator.
// TODO  Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
// TODO  Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
